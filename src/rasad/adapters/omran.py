    """Build a Rasad-compatible model function that runs Omran.

    Parameters
    ----------
    omran_src
        Absolute path to Omran's ``src`` directory. It is inserted at the
        front of ``sys.path`` if not already present, so that ``nation``
        and ``world`` can be imported from outside the Omran project.
    years
        How many simulated years each run performs.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable[[dict, int], dict]
        A closure ``run(params, seed)`` that seeds Python's global RNG,
        builds a fresh set of nations, steps Omran's ``WorldModel`` for
        ``years`` years with stdout suppressed, and returns Omran's output
        as scalars plus a population trace. ``params`` accepts a single
        key, ``nations``: a list of dicts, each holding the keyword
        arguments for Omran's ``Nation(name, population, food,
        growth_rate)``. When the key is absent, the three defaults in
        ``_DEFAULT_NATIONS`` are used. A fresh ``Nation`` is built on
        every run; instances are never reused between runs.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When the returned ``run`` is called with a ``params`` dict that
        contains any key other than ``nations``. The offending keys are
        named in the message so a setting can never be silently ignored.
