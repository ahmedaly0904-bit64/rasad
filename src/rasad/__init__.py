    """Measure the robustness of a simulation model's output.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fn
        A model matching the simulation interface
        ``def run(params: dict, seed: int) -> dict``.
    params
        The simulation parameters, fixed across every run.
    runs
        How many runs to make. Must be at least 2.
    base_seed
        The seed of the first run; run ``i`` gets ``base_seed + i``.
    thresholds
        The classification cutoffs. ``None`` means use the default
        :data:`rasad.analyzer.THRESHOLDS`. These values are a convention
        the caller owns — they describe what counts as "robust" /
        "wobbly" / "fragile" for this measurement and are not derived
        from the data. A supplied dict is validated before any run.

    Returns
    -------
    Report
        Per scalar output its summary plus a verdict, per series output
        its divergence curve, the run count, and the thresholds used.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When ``runs`` is below 2, or when ``thresholds`` fails
        :func:`rasad.analyzer.validate_thresholds`.
