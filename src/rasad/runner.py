"""Execute a plan of simulation runs and collect the raw outputs.

The runner turns a plan from :mod:`rasad.sampler` into results: it
calls the model once per plan entry, in plan order, and returns the
output dicts in that same order. Execution is deliberately sequential;
parallelism is explicitly out of scope for this version.

The model is validated up front so a bad model fails immediately
instead of after wasted work, and every run must return the same set of
output keys or the batch is rejected — a report built from shifting keys
could not be summarized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fn
        A model matching the simulation interface
        ``def run(params: dict, seed: int) -> dict``.
    plan
        The list of ``(params, seed)`` pairs produced by

    Returns
    -------
    list[dict]
        One output dict per plan entry, in plan order.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        When ``fn`` is not a valid model, or when a run returns
        something other than a dict.
    ValueError
        When runs do not all return the same set of output keys.
    Exception
        Any exception raised by the model propagates unchanged, with a
        note attached naming the seed of the run that raised it.
